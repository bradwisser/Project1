# Epicodus Project 1
###Bradley Wisser

**Goal** This is the project for the first section of the part-time, evening class at Epicodus, which focuses on Git/HTML/CSS practice. We are to build a simple, responsive website and publish it via Github Pages.

**Requirements:**

* Your name
* An image of you or something that represents who you are
* A list of projects you have created with active links to them including a description
* An "About Me" section including background information and the reason for enrolling at Epicodus
* Create a gh-pages branch so that this site will be live on GitHub Pages--including a README for the project

**Page must include:**

1. HTML tags: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span
2. Bootstrap classes
3. A custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and floats
4. Proper indentation and spacing of HTML/CSS

**Issues with my project**

* I use only one Bootstrap class: Jumbotron. I didn't want to rely too heavily on Bootstrap for this first project. I wanted it to be a simple site that met the requirements for the class without being super flashy.
* While I built a responsive webpage, designed to change at viewport max-width: 767px, I didn't change too much of the layout. I dropped the image and centered the text for the sections and Jumbotron class.
* It's a bit overly basic. I tend to get these grandiose ideas of how I want to do things so I forced myself to ditch flashy ideas and stick to the requirements, instead aiming to meet each of them.
* Some people don't like white text on a black background. I do, and I kept the Jumbotron color scheme to help the page pop a little.
