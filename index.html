			<p>As the title suggests, this is a page dedicated to the first project for the <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> evening class. The class is wrapping up a section that introduces students to Git, Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS), and HTML. It would take the students from having very little knowledge of building websites (and for most working with Macs and Bash) to being able build responsive and somewhat basic websites using HTML and CSS. For me, I had already been working ahead on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, so a lot of the work we covered in the section was repetitive; however, the classes and partners forced me to practice--which I'm grateful for.</p>

			<p>The requirements for this project are to build a basic website that includes the information and elements/practices below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your name</li>
				<li>An image of you or something that represents who you are</li>
				<li>A list of projects you have created with active links to them including a description</li>
				<li>An "About Me" section including background information and the reason for enrolling at Epicodus</li>
				<li>Create a gh-pages branch so that this site will be live on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>--including a README for the project</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our page should include the below elements and practices:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>HTML tags: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span</li>
				<li>Bootstrap classes</li>
				<li>A custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and floats</li>
				<li>Proper indentation and spacing of HTML/CSS</li>
			</ol>
