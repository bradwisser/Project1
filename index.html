			<h4>About The Project</h4>
			<p>As the title suggests, this is a page dedicated to the first project for the <a href="http://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> evening class. The class is wrapping up a section that introduces students to Git, Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS), and HTML. It would take the students from having very little knowledge of building websites (and for most working with Macs and Bash) to being able build responsive and somewhat basic websites using HTML and CSS. For me, I had already been working ahead on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, so a lot of the work we covered in the section was repetitive; however, the classes and partners forced me to practice--which I'm grateful for.</p>

			<p>The requirements for this project are to build a basic website that includes the information and elements/practices below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your name</li>
				<li>An image of you or something that represents who you are</li>
				<li>A list of projects you have created with active links to them including a description</li>
				<li>An "About Me" section including background information and the reason for enrolling at Epicodus</li>
				<li>Create a gh-pages branch so that this site will be live on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>--including a README for the project</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our page should include the below elements and practices:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>HTML tags: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span</li>
				<li>Bootstrap classes</li>
				<li>A custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and floats</li>
				<li>Proper indentation and spacing of HTML/CSS</li>
			</ol>

				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<p>Firstly, I'd like to state that I <span style="strong">really</span> don't like talking about myself; always have and probably always will. Since it's part of the requirements I'll throw some stuff in here but I really don't enjoy this part.</p>
				<p>The briefest history I can say is that I was born and raised in Oregon. Currently I live in Portland and...have mixed emotions about it. I love the architecture, the nature, the fact that I can step out of my apartment and see raccoons, squirrels, birds, and only occasionally a rat. I'm not a huge fan of the people, though. <em>(this sectiono has been edited to remove grumpy, ranty content--in short I definitely do not like the majority of the people who frequent downtown Portland)</em> My technical experience with computers/software goes back roughly 18 years when I started hanging out with "nerd" friends who were more into computers than I was. I soon followed suit, building simple webpages on Geocities/Angelfire, as well as investing some money into building a gaming computer. Over the next 10 years my knowledge and gear expanded into the above-average range with my hardware nearing the value of $1500. I enrolled at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">Portland State University's</a> <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> program. I completed 2 years before dropping out. During this time I took a course on Python and 2 courses focused on C++ and programming. Afterwards I found a job at a local foreclosure law firm and worked there for 1.5 years. I kept trying to decide how I would get into a technical vocation, trying to decide on either tech support or programming. Finally, in March, I applied to Epicodus' evening class after talking with a few friends and reading reviews about Epicodus. And then, a month later, I was laid off from my job. Shame they didn't tell me they were going to do that sooner so I could apply for the full-time course! But now, here we are, with me still trying to decide what I want to do for my future while I take a part-time programming class.
